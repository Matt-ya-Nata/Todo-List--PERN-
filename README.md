---

## üßæ Overview

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that allows users to manage a to-do list. The project demonstrates how to set up a full-stack application using:

- A PostgreSQL database to store data  
- An Express + Node.js backend to provide RESTful API services  
- A React frontend for user interaction  

The app is based on the structure taught in a video by FreeCodeCamp.
